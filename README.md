# PYTHON PERLIN NOISE

A Python implementation of the Perlin Noise Algorithm as described [here](https://rtouti.github.io/graphics/perlin-noise-algorithm). This code is not optimized or properly formatted, but was made for educational purposes.

You are free to use this code for whatever purpose you like, but if you want perlin noise in Python I recommend [this library](https://pypi.org/project/perlin-noise/).
